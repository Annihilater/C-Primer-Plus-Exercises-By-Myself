While President Donald Trump obsesses about his reelection hopes in his White House
bubble, state and local leaders are frantically reversing state reopenings that he
demanded, which turned America into
the world's biggest coronavirus hotspot.
As emergency rooms filled and the virus quickened its relentless march across southern
and Western states, Trump stuck
to the fiction that the worst is already over: "We had to close it down;
now we're opening it up," the President said
of the economy at the White House, patting himself on the back for saving "millions of lives."
As new cases of the disease reach 60,000 a day nationwide, many leaders,
including those who supported Trump's
aggressive approach, now have little choice but to prioritize science over politics,
leaving the President looking out
of touch with reality.
In Texas, Houston's Democratic Mayor Sylvester Turner proposed a two-week shutdown,
days after Republican Gov. Greg
Abbott raised the possibility of more stringent measures after issuing
a mask wearing mandate that offended
conservative orthodoxy. West Virginia called time's up in bars in the worst-hit county.
In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the closure of all indoor restaurants,
wineries, movie theaters,
zoos, museums and shut all bars. Los Angeles and San Diego said their kids would
start the new school year online only.
Oregon banned gatherings of more than 10 people inside because of an "alarming rise" of
Covid-19 cases in the state.
KFC encouraged franchises in Florida, Texas, Oklahoma and California to stop dine-in service.
Florida, which on Saturday set the record for any state in single day data on new infections,
now has more Covid-19 cases than all but eight entire countries.
